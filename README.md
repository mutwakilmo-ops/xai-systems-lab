## 📦 What’s in this Repo

This repository demonstrates my work across **three core areas**, directly aligned to the roles I am applying for:

### 1️⃣ High-Throughput AI Backend (`/api-gateway-grok/`)
- Rust-based API service designed for scale and reliability  
- Async pipelines, gRPC APIs, backpressure handling  
- PostgreSQL metadata + ClickHouse analytics  
- Prometheus metrics & observability  

### 2️⃣ Enterprise AI Agent Platform (`/enterprise-ai-agents/`)
- Rust orchestration engine + Python AI microservices  
- LLM API integrations, embeddings, and RAG pipelines  
- Workflow execution with retries, compensation, and deterministic state  
- Designed for enterprise-scale complexity  

### 3️⃣ AI Network Automation (`/ai-network-automation/`)

- Zero-touch provisioning and auto-remediation simulations  
- Metrics-first design for AI-scale GPU fabrics  
- TCP/IP, BGP, and RDMA-aware abstractions  

---

## 🔧 Core Principles Across All Projects

- **Ownership over abstraction** — every component is production-grade  
- **Observability is non-negotiable** — metrics, logs, and traces everywhere  
- **Failure is expected** — designed to recover and scale  
- **Tradeoffs are explicit** — every design choice is explained

## 🎯 Why This Repo Matters

This is **my personal xAI prep lab**. It shows:

- I can **think like a systems engineer**  
- I can **implement production-grade solutions in multiple languages**  
- I am **ready to contribute immediately** to xAI’s mission  
- I understand the **real-world complexity of AI infrastructure, enterprise agents, and high-performance networks**  

This is not a practice repo. It is **my golden ticket to xAI**.
